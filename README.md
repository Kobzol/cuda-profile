## CUDA memory access profiler

This repository contains an instrumentation pass for LLVM that extracts memory accesses
made by CUDA kernels. The stored accesses can then be visualised using a web dashboard in order
to spot memory access patterns.

You can find the instrumentation pass in the `collection` folder and the dashboard in the
`visualisation` folder.

This software work was created as a part of my master's thesis at
VŠB-TUO: Technical University of Ostrava. The text of the thesis can be found in the
folder `thesis`.
